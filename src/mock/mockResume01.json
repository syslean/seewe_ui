I led the backend development in the team. This system is based on Java and Spring. In addition to providing the mobile application with an interface for data presentation and data exchange, there is also a need to think deeply about user privacy protection. When first take on the project, I need to refactor the code left over from the previous company. I refactored the overall architecture of the code and introduced the design of micro-services and DDD. Extensive tests have been rewritten to ensure the high availability of code. In-depth design of the application's interface to respond to the instantaneous high volume of network requests generated by large-scale marketing campaigns. Ensure that there are no breakdowns during the campaign promotion."
